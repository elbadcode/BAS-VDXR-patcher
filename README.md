quick patcher I made to update a tutorial on nexusmods. This helps setup blade and sorcery to use VDXR on oculus headsets which significantly improves tracking and performance. I recommend just taking the archive from releases and extracing directly in your game directory. If your game is installed outside of the default location this is the required way to use it. I did add the ability to give it a commandline arg or drag your steamlibrary folders file onto it but those are giving errors. I realized that they're actually just useless features anyway so I won't fix
